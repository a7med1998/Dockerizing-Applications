## 5. Copying Remaining Files - `COPY . .`

- **Description**: This command copies all remaining files from the project directory to the container.
- **Modifiable Part**: If your source files are in a different directory, adjust the paths accordingly.
- **Example Modification**: If your source code is in a `src` directory, you could change this to `COPY src/. .`.

---

## 6. Building the Application - `RUN npm run build -- --prod`

- **Description**: This command builds the Angular application in production mode.
- **Modifiable Part**: You can change the build command to match your specific build scripts or configurations.
- **Example Modification**: If you have a custom build configuration, you might change it to `RUN npm run build -- --configuration=staging`.

---

## 7. Base Runtime Image - `FROM nginx:alpine AS production`

- **Description**: Specifies the base image for the runtime environment using Nginx.
- **Modifiable Part**: You can choose a different version or variant of Nginx based on your needs.

---

## 8. Copying Built Files - `COPY --from=build /app/dist/your-app-name /usr/share/nginx/html`

- **Description**: Copies the built application files from the build stage to the Nginx directory for serving.
- **Modifiable Part**: Update the path if you change the output directory in the build stage or if your application has a different output folder name.
- **Example Modification**: If your built files are in a folder named `my-angular-app`, modify it to `COPY --from=build /app/dist/my-angular-app /usr/share/nginx/html`.

---

## 9. Exposing a Port - `EXPOSE 80`

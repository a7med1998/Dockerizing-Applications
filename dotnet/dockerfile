# Stage 1: Build the .NET application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
# Explanation: We start with the .NET SDK (version 7.0) image as the base for the build stage.
# This image includes everything needed to compile and publish .NET code.

WORKDIR /src
# Explanation: Set the working directory to "/src" for the build stage to keep files organized.

COPY *.csproj ./
# Explanation: Copy the project file (e.g., .csproj) to the container so we can restore dependencies.
# This helps optimize layer caching, as dependencies will only be restored if the project file changes.

RUN dotnet restore
# Explanation: Restore any dependencies specified in the project file to prepare for the build.

COPY . .
# Explanation: Copy the remaining application files from the project directory to the container.

RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish
# Explanation: Build the application in Release mode and output the published files to "/app/publish".


# Stage 2: Run the .NET application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS runtime
# Explanation: Use a lightweight .NET runtime image for running the application, making the final image smaller.

WORKDIR /app
# Explanation: Set the working directory to "/app" in the runtime container for the published files.

COPY --from=build /app/publish .
# Explanation: Copy the published files from the build stage to the runtime stage.
# This step brings only the necessary files needed to run the application, excluding the build tools.

EXPOSE 80
# Explanation: Expose port 80 for HTTP access to the application.

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourApp.dll"]
# Explanation: Define the entrypoint to start the application by running the specified DLL file.
# Replace "YourApp.dll" with the actual name of your application's DLL file.
